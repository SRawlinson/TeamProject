# TeamProject

This was a module in the second semester of my MSc in Software Development; a team project to develop a program allowing users to play a 
game of Top Trumps both via the command line and online. It was developed in five weeks in collaboration with James Brown, Maxine Simpson, 
Isobel Betteridge, and Liam James. Grade: A2
